I've worked with FPGAs since the '80s, but with Python and Jupyter only in the past few years.
PYNQ combines all these interests into a single noetic particle.
This site will record my clumsy experiments as I explore that particle.

I don't intend this as a tutorial on using Zynq or Pynq: there are
plenty of those already and I'll reference them as needed.
Rather, I'll use these posts to tamp the things I learn about PYNQ into my
own head.
That's a big enough job on its own, but if any of this helps you, then great!
However, that wasn't my intended purpose.

My thanks to Patrick Lysaght of Xilinx who allowed me to con him out of a PYNQ board.
He is indirectly to blame for the creation of this site, but not for any of its contents.
